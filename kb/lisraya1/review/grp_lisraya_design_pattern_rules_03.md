## Original text

````
### Brand Accent Shape (core container device)
- A rectangle with **selectively enlarged opposite corner radii**; the other two corners keep a slight radius. Used to house callout text and photography. Reads modern and optimistic.
- Approved radius pairs (print): **1.25" & 0.0625"** (large containers/photos), **0.5" & 0.0625"** (banners), **0.4375" & 0.0625"** (small callout boxes).
- **[GENERAL] Email px conversions (at 96dpi):** large: 120px & 6px; banner: 48px & 6px; callout: 42px & 6px. Apply the large radius to one diagonal pair (e.g., top-left + bottom-right), the 6px radius to the other pair. Be consistent within an email: same diagonal orientation across all sections (default: large radius top-left & bottom-right).
- **Exception: charts and tables use uniform rounded corners on all four corners** (not the asymmetric accent shape). [GENERAL: 12px uniform radius.]

- rule_text: Apply the large radius to one diagonal pair (e.g., top-left + bottom-right) and the 6px radius to the other pair. Be consistent within an email: use the same diagonal orientation across all sections (default: large radius top-left & bottom-right).
- intent: Keep accent-shape orientation consistent across an email for a coherent look.
